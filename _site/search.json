Enabling research in this area are many unique, and often single-purpose, simulation environments. The variety of simulation options is useful for creating finely tuned experiments but makes it difficult for newcomers to the field to determine which simulation environment is appropriate for their particular problem.\nALIFE has also hosted several tutorials relating to this work, for example,\nThis tutorial, will provide a broader look at the paradigms and tools used in the field of evolutionary robotics (and in ALIFE more generally). Specifically, we will discuss the use of several different simulation methods and tools, including:\nWe will also discuss visualization techniques.\nOf course, covering this wide range of topics necessarily means that we will not be able to go into great depth on all of them. Instead we will pay special attention to the use of physical simulation engines as they provide the widest range of possibilities with respect to creating and evolving virtual creatures. Staying with the theme of ALIFE 2024 we will share our experiences with “weird and wacky” results (and how to avoid them if they are not what you are looking for)."

    "text": "Simulation plays a vital role in optimization and in understanding evolutionary dynamics. SimER focuses on rigid-body dynamics, but we’ve listed a few related ideas below as well.\nCreating a simulation is called “modeling.” In robotics, modeling is used for simulation, state estimation, prediction, and model-based algorithms (e.g., model predictive control, model-based reinforcement learning).\nBroadly, we can list the following forms of simulation as it relates to evolutionary robotics (ER)\nOften, an increase in accuracy comes at the cost of an increase in complexity and compute time. Analytical simulations are often only useful for toy problems (i.e., they are not even expressive enough to simulate a double pendulum system). Numerical systems are much broader—in some sense, they encapsulate rigid-body and soft-body dynamics—but they are often slower and less powerful compared to rigid-body and soft-body simulators. For example, a nonholonomic system cannot be described by a closed-form solution. In this case, a numerical or physical simulation is required.\nHere are things to consider when selecting your simulation tool:",
