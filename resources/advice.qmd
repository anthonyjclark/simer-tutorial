- statistics (replicates)
- noise
- determinism
- levels-of-abstraction
  - use appropriate level of abstraction
  - what do you care about
  - spherical wheels
  - do you care about electro-mechanical properties of the motors
  - fake hydrodynamics
- feasibility and constraints
- seed values
- multi-evaluation with different initial conditions
- avoid stiff springs
- scale parameters in 0.1 to 10 range (1 is sweet spot)
- parallelize
  - evaluation with threads
  - processes with `parallel`
- faster than real-time
- early stopping simulation/evaluation: stuck, flipped, etc.
  - want a good gradient
- early stopping evolution: no progress, etc.\
- swap out simulators
- swap out algorithms
- fitness exploitation
- algorithm checkpoint
- controls and baselines
- incrementally introduce fitness:
  - start simple
  - add complexity
  - distance to target
  - then penalize hitting wall

## Mixed Environments

mixing 2d and 3d
- e.g., ODE and top-down map ray tracing
