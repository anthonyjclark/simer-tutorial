This is the second occurrence of SimER. The first was as a [workshop held at GECCO 2017](https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3067695#heading19). Here are the contributions from the workshop:

- [20 years of reality gap: a few thoughts about simulators in evolutionary robotics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3067695.3082052) by Jean-Baptiste Mouret and Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis
- [Simulating the evolution of soft and rigid-body robots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3067695.3082051) by Sam Kriegman, Collin Cappelle, Francesco Corucci, Anton Bernatskiy, Nick Cheney, and Josh C. Bongard
- [A baseline-realistic objective open-ended kinematics simulator for evolutionary robotics](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3067695.3082164) by Riley Konsella, Frank Chiarulli, John Peterson, and John Rieffel
